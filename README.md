 # :label: [Introduction](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-examples-junit5#introduction) 

Welcome to BrowserStack JUnit 5 Examples, a sample UI testing framework empowered with **[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)** and **[JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)**. Along with the framework the repository also contains a collection of sample test scripts written for **[BrowserStack Demo Application](https://bstackdemo.com/)**.

This repository includes a number of **[sample configuration files](/src/test/resources)** to run these on tests on various platforms including **on-premise browsers**, browsers running on a remote selenium grid such as **[BrowserStack Automate](https://www.browserstack.com/automate)** or in a **[Docker container](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium)**. The framework and test scripts are configured to run with both **[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)** and **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)**. Starter **[gradle.build](/build.gradle)** and **[pom.xml](/pom.xml)** files are also included in the project.

 ## Tests Included in this Repository
 
 Following are the test cases included in this repository:

| Module   | Test Case                          | Description |
  | ---   | ---                                   | --- |
| [E2E](/src/test/java/com/browserstack/examples/tests/e2e)      | [PurchaseTest](/src/test/java/com/browserstack/examples/tests/e2e/PurchaseTest.java)                | This test scenario verifies successful product purchase lifecycle end-to-end. It demonstrates the [Page Object Model design pattern](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/page-object-model-in-selenium) and is also the default test executed in all the single test run profiles. |
| [Login](/src/test/java/com/browserstack/examples/tests/login)    | [RedirectionTest](/src/test/java/com/browserstack/examples/tests/login/RedirectionTest.java)         | This test verifies that the user needs to login to view the favourites marked by him or her. |
| Login    | Login as Locked User               | This test verifies the login workflow error for a locked user. |
| Offers   | Offers for Mumbai location     | This test mocks the GPS location for Mumbai and verifies that the product offers applicable for the Mumbai location are shown.   |
| Product  | Apply Apple Vendor Filter          | This test verifies that 9 Apple products are only shown if the Apple vendor filter option is applied. |
| Product  | Apply Lowest to Highest Order By   | This test verifies that the product prices are in ascending order when the product sort "Lowest to Highest" is applied. |
| User     | Login as User with no image loaded | This test verifies that the product images load for user: "image_not_loading_user" on the e-commerce application. Since the images do not load, the test case assertion fails.|
| User     | Login as User with existing Orders |  This test verifies that existing orders are shown for user: "existing_orders_user"  |

 # :wrench:  [Repository Configuration](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-examples-junit5#repositoryconfiguration)
 
The repository is designed to execute on any browser managed by a selenium webdriver. As an example the included configuration files are designed to run on the following three setups. 
1. On Premise Browsers
2. Browsers running in a docker container
3. Browsers on BrowserStack Automate

The repository is also designed to execute on both public as well as a locally hosted copy of the demo application. The prerequisites and setup details for all of these variations are labeled respectively.

 ## Configuring Concurrency Parameters ![Maven](https://img.shields.io/badge/With-maven-indigo) ![Gradle](https://img.shields.io/badge/With-gradle-green)

On BrowserStack Automate, you can spin multiple browser instances in parallel to reduce your over all build time. With JUnit 5 you configure the number concurrent test executions to an optimal count. In the sample POM or Gradle builld file in the repository it is set to a value 5 using the  <code>junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.fixed.parallelism</code> property. All such JUnit 5 configurations are gouped in these files together. Change these values as per your convenience to achieve the level of concurrency you desire.

 # :rocket:  [Test Execution](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-examples-junit5#testexecution)
 
 ## Test Execution Prerequisites [![OnPrem](https://img.shields.io/badge/For-OnPrem-green)]()
 
 :pushpin: Install [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).
 <br>
 :pushpin: Install [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
 <br>
 :pushpin: Add the path of Chrome Driver in on-prem configuration fies [capabilities-on-prem.yml](/src/test/resources/capabilities-on-prem.yml) and [capabilities-on-prem-suite.yml](/src/test/resources/capabilities-on-prem-suite.yml) as <code>driverPath</code>.

 ## Test Execution Prerequisites ![OnDocker](https://img.shields.io/badge/For-OnDocker-blue)
 
Run <code>docker-compose pull</code> from the current directory of the repository.
 
Start the Docker by running the following command:
 
 <code>docker-compose up -d</code>

 ## Test Execution Prerequisites ![BrowserStack](https://img.shields.io/badge/For-BrowserStackAutomate-orange)
 
 - Create a new [BrowserStack account](https://www.browserstack.com/users/sign_up) or use an existing one.
- Identify your BrowserStack username and access key from the [BrowserStack Automate Dashboard](https://automate.browserstack.com/) and export them as environment variables using the below commands.

  - For \*nix based and Mac machines:

  ```sh
  export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username> &&
  export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```

  - For Windows:

  ```shell
  set BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<browserstack-username>
  set BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<browserstack-access-key>
  ```

  Alternatively, you can also hardcode username and access_key objects in the [caps.json](resources/conf/caps/caps.json) file.

Note:
- We have configured a list of test capabilities in the [caps.json](resources/conf/caps/caps.json) file. You can certainly update them based on your device / browser test requirements.
- The exact test capability values can be easily identified using the [Browserstack Capability Generator](https://browserstack.com/automate/capabilities)

 ## Test Execution Prerequisites ![Local](https://img.shields.io/badge/For-Local-yellow)
 - Clone the [BrowserStack demo application](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-demo-app) repository.
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-demo-app
  ``` 
- Please follow the README.md on the BrowserStack demo application repository to install and start the dev server on localhost.
- In this section, we will run a single test case to test the BrowserStack Demo app hosted on your local machine i.e. localhost. Refer to the `single_local` object in `caps.json` file to change test capabilities for this configuration.
- Note: You may need to provide additional BrowserStackLocal arguments to successfully connect your localhost environment with BrowserStack infrastructure. (e.g if you are behind firewalls, proxy or VPN).
- Further details for successfully creating a BrowserStackLocal connection can be found here:

  - [Local Testing with Automate](https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing/automate)
  - [BrowserStackLocal Java GitHub](https://github.com/browserstack/browserstack-local-java)
